## 📁 Step 1: Create Your Label Tree

Create these 9 labels in Gmail (Settings → Labels → Create new label):

```
CRM/
├── Urgent
├── Stage-1/
│   ├── T0-Broadcast
│   ├── T1-Escalation
│   ├── T2-Escalation
│   ├── T3-Escalation
│   └── T4-Final-Warning
├── Reminders/
│   ├── 10-Min
│   └── 1-Hour
└── Actions/
    └── Reassigned
```

**How to create nested labels:**
1. Create `CRM` first
2. Create `Stage-1` and select "Nest label under: CRM"
3. Create `T0-Broadcast` and select "Nest label under: CRM/Stage-1"
4. Repeat for all sub-labels

## 🔧 How to Create Each Filter

### Step 1: Open Gmail Filter Creator
1. Click the **search box** at the top of Gmail
2. Click the **filter icon** (sliders) on the right side

### Step 2: Enter Search Query
1. In the **"Has the words"** field, paste the search query from the filter section above
2. Click **"Create filter"** at the bottom

### Step 3: Configure Actions
1. Check the boxes listed in the filter's actions
2. For **"Apply label"**, select the matching label from the dropdown
3. Click **"Create filter"**

### Step 4: For Dual-Label Filters (Filters 1–4)
Since Gmail only allows one label per filter rule, you must create **two filters** with the same search query:
1. Create the first filter → apply the **stage label** (e.g., CRM/Stage-1/T1-Escalation)
2. Create a second filter with the **same query** → apply the **reminder/urgency label** (e.g., CRM/Reminders/10-Min)

### Step 5: Verify
1. Find a matching email in your inbox
2. Confirm **both labels** were applied correctly
3. If not, edit the filter and adjust the query
